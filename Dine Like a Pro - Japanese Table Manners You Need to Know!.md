Have you ever felt awkward at a Japanese restaurant not knowing the proper way to eat? Well, today we're going to be diving into the fascinating world of Japanese dining etiquette. So, let me show you some important dos and don'ts for your next visit to a restaurant in Japan. With these simple rules, you'll know exactly how to dine like a local. But before we go, make sure to subscribe for more awesome Japan content.

**Table Manners Background:**
Many of you may know that Japanese culture and Japanese etiquette can be very meticulous and, at times, complex. But did you know that the origin of this actually started in the 16th and 17th century with Japanese Samurai? Japanese Samurai were always armed with swords, so at the table, there needed to be a kind of truce in order to maintain peace amongst all parties. This is how the ritualized practice of Tea Ceremony came to be. Samurai had to adhere to the many rules and manners in order to maintain a sense of harmony and peace, at least while within the confines of the Tea Room. Tea Ceremony is not the only place where you can see this kind of rigid adherence to manners. You can still see this in food culture and also in business even in Japan today. 

I am here now at Ginza, and I'm going to be going to a sushi restaurant called Sushi. It's a high-end sushi restaurant that's hidden down these stairs. There are a couple of things to keep in mind when you go to a sushi restaurant. One of those things is to **Rule 1: always come on time.** Japanese people are known for their punctuality, and if you come late to a sushi restaurant, there is a high possibility that even if you had a reservation, your spot will be canceled. This is to make sure that everybody at the restaurant can enjoy the sushi experience fully. The other thing to make sure of is sushi restaurants are fancy restaurants, so make sure to dress up nicely when you go to a sushi restaurant. And also, fun fact, you're actually not supposed to wear perfumes or cologne or anything that smells strongly when you go into a sushi restaurant. But let's go inside and find out.

**Sushi Restaurant:**
There are some restaurants where they actually have a plate for you to dip your sushi into the soy sauce and leave some Wasabi on the side. In that case, you can add a little bit of Wasabi on top of your sushi if you would like more. But you should never open up your sushi and put it inside. If you open it up, that's extremely disrespectful, and you should never do that at any sushi restaurant.

It's totally up to you at sushi restaurants whether you eat it with your hands or chopsticks. Both are totally okay. And if you're going to eat with your hands, they will give you this little wipe to clean your hands, and then you can just pick it up like so. Okay, so we'll take it in one bite. Here we go. Wow, that is really, really, really good. I don't know what it is, but I really, really like this sushi. Not only because the fish is so fresh, but also the red vinegar and the rice is a really nice touch.

Mmm, this is really, really good. The texture of the clam is kind of similar to a scallop. It's really meaty. It has a little bit of a hint of spice to it because of the ichimi um and the soy sauce. It blends together so well. And finished off with a crisp, nori seaweed on the end.

So, the rice has actually changed. The type of vinegar that he uses for the rice is not the red vinegar anymore, so it's a little bit more mild. It was really buttery, even a little bit sweet. Creamy, isn't it? For anybody who loves fried things, that is really fantastic. It's basically a creamy crab cake that's been crisply deep-fried. The outside is really nice and crisp and crunchy, and the inside is creamy, and you get that umami from the crab. This is actually my first time having anago eel with two different kinds of seasonings. I'm going to start with the salt since that's recommended. Mmm, that is a wonderful, gentle but heavenly flavor, actually. Wow, it's just this really fluffy and warm meat from the anago eel. Just very delicately salted, and you can enjoy the taste of the vinegar and the rice as well. It brings it all together so beautifully. Let's have our last bite of sushi for my lunch today. This is the one with the sweet sauce. Mmm, that is really tasty. It's also a very delicate flavor, and the sauce is also not overpowering at all. It's very faintly sweet with a little bit of that teriyaki-like umami, and then the rice brings it all together again with this wonderful deep red vinegar flavor. It's just kind of a richer vinegar. I think this is a wonderful way to end my sushi lunch course today, and I'm very glad that I didn't wear perfume so I could enjoy all of those flavors for what they truly are. All right, it's time for me to keep exploring, and also, let's go learn some manners at other Japanese restaurants. See you guys at the next spot.

**Ramen Shop:**
Here we are now at Fuunji. This is a wonderful local ramen shop that's in the Shinjuku and Yoyogi area, and the locals absolutely love it. They'll line up for like 2 hours outside just to eat here. So let's go inside and learn how to eat it the right way.

First off, when you come to a ramen restaurant, you usually need to order your ramen from this ticket machine. Most ramen shops have them, and they're very easy to use. You just put your coins in your money, your bills in here, and then you choose whatever ramen you want. So, I'm going to go with the special ramen today. Yay, and we've got our ticket, and you give it to the shop staff, and then they'll make your ramen for you.

Wow, what a delicious-looking bowl of ramen. The soup looks so rich. One thing that's important to do in Japan at any restaurant, whether it's ramen, sushi, wherever you go, is to say **Rule 7: itadakimasu** before you eat. This roughly translates to "I will humbly receive this food." It's really showing respect to both the food itself and also to the person who makes the food. Say it with me: "Itadakimasu!"

I want to debunk the myth that you have to slurp your noodles in Japan in order to be polite. It is true that slurping your ramen shows some appreciation to the owner. The reason is that if you're slurping it, obviously, it seems like you're really enjoying your food. You're just trying to get it in your mouth as fast as possible, so they appreciate it when you do slurp, but it's really up to you.

Another reason why ramen fanatics usually recommend to slurp your ramen is because it allows more air and also soup

 to enter your mouth as you're eating the noodles, which adds more flavor. Oh, actually, I think the slurping did help a lot. I got a burst of flavor in that bite. Oh my goodness, the soup is so rich. It's like a creamy chicken broth.

One other thing that's not specifically a rule but it's not really ideal in ramen culture specifically is that you're not supposed to bite the noodles before they go in your mouth. The solution is you use your **Rule 9: Hishaku** (soup spoon). So, you take a small handful of noodles and then you put it on your ladle. That way you can control the amount of noodles that are going to be eating. Mmm, it worked, and it's very delicious. I'm going to be doing that from now on. Give it a try.

One other chopstick-related rule in Japan is that you're not actually supposed to point with your chopsticks. And when you're done eating or if you're taking a break from eating, don't stab your chopsticks into the noodles. This is considered actually kind of impolite. So, instead, you should put your chopsticks neatly on your bowl. Like so, and that's a good way to take a pause from eating if you've eaten too much and you're full.

Woo, that was an amazing bowl of ramen. Very, very filling. I think since the soup is so rich, it does make you feel extra full. And now I want to mention, what do you do with the soup? It's actually very common to not finish your soup in Japan, but if you do want to drink some soup, you can also drink it directly from the bowl. Mmm, rich and delicious.

And there you have it. That's basically some things to keep in mind when you eat ramen. I have another place to take you guys to learn a little bit more about Japanese food etiquette. Let's go to the next place.

**Izakaya Restaurant:**
My final stop of the day is the famous restaurant GONPACHI located in Nishi-Azabu. This Izakaya restaurant is particularly renowned for being the restaurant that was the model for the famous fight scene in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill. So, let's go inside and try some of their incredible food, and I'll show you a few tips and etiquette for eating in a Japanese Izakaya.

What a great atmosphere, and look, this place is so famous. Countless celebrities have visited here, including Prime Ministers and Presidents. This is so crazy. So yeah, this is clearly a popular restaurant. Let's go inside.

Wow, this place looks incredible. It looks exactly like the movie. And fun fact for you guys, some people may think that the movie was actually filmed in this restaurant. It was actually filmed in China, and they made a set that looks exactly like this restaurant. The atmosphere here is gorgeous. The staff is so lively, and it feels like I'm in Old Japan. It kind of feels like I'm outdoors in an old Japanese town. It's beautiful. This is my seat, and as per Japanese Izakaya style, you take off your shoes before you sit down. Even though this particular area isn't tatami flooring, but this one you can put your feet in. It's very comfortable. But let's take off our shoes.

All right, time to order. Let's start with drinks. When we think of Izakaya, we start with beer. In Japan, we have a phrase called **Rule 14: toriaezu beer**. So, I'm starting with this Kin Ichiban shibori, and it's in a bottle, of course. Draft beer is okay too, but I'm going to show you guys the pouring culture.

So, now that we have our two glasses of beer, it's time to **Rule 17: kampai**, or cheers to somebody that you want to show respect for. When you clink glasses, you want to lower your glass like so, not directly up here. So, I'm going to do a little low clink. Let's give it a try. Ready? Kampai. Kampai. There are some cases where you'll order the drinks and everybody's waiting. You might feel inclined to take a sip, but you shouldn't. In Japanese culture, you don't take the first sip of your drink until the group kampai has been done. Isayas are meant for sharing. So that's why you will always have something called **Rule 18: tana**, which are it literally translates to taking plate. So let's use our **Rule 19: tezara** and I'm going to start by trying this wagyu sirloin steak. It looks so good. So here's quiz time: Do you guys remember what we say before we eat? That's right, "Itadakimasu!"

I want to debunk the myth that you have to slurp your noodles in Japan in order to be polite. It is true that slurping your ren shows some appreciation, to the owner.
