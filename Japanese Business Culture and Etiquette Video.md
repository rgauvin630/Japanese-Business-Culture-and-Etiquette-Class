## **Hello everyone, welcome to Business School 101!**

With the third largest nominal GDP, Japan is one of the largest and most developed economies in the world. Japan is also the home of many global Fortune 500 companies, which include Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba, and many more.

So, what is Japan's general business environment? Can we apply Hofstede's cultural framework to analyze Japan's business culture? Do Japanese companies obtain unique organizational cultures or business etiquettes? In this video, I will discuss these topics with you.

## **Section 1: General Business Environment**

Japan's economy was the world's second-largest from 1968 until 2010 when it was overtaken by China. According to the World Bank, Japan's nominal GDP in 2019 was estimated to be $5.06 trillion US dollars. Its GDP per capita is around $40,100, which is slightly less than two-thirds of America's GDP per capita but is almost equivalent to the United Kingdom and France. In addition, the Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.

On the Corruption Perception Index 2020, Japan ranks 19th out of 180 countries, receiving a score of 74 on a scale from zero to one hundred. This suggests that the country's public sector is relatively free from corruption.

In terms of education, Japan's populace is well-educated, and its society places high value on education as a platform both for socioeconomic mobility and for gaining employment in the country's high-tech economy. English is a compulsory subject in junior high and high schools. There are also elementary schools that introduce English education within intermediate-grade classes.

According to the 2020 data, Japan has a population of 125.7 million and has the second-longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world, sitting at 84 years. It is also worth noting that the Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post-World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates.

## **Section 2: Japan's Hofstede Scores**

As we covered in a previous video, Hofstede's cultural framework is one of the most widely used tools to analyze a country's culture. Therefore, let's check Japan's scores in Hofstede's six-dimensional cultural framework. Please keep in mind that the Hofstede score on each dimension ranges on a scale from zero to one hundred.

## **Section 3: Organizational Cultures**

Generally, Japanese organizational cultures have four features: consensus, hierarchy, loyalty, and relationship-oriented. Let's discuss them individually.

**Consensus:** In larger Japanese businesses and institutions, consensus is stressed as the primary way to arrive at decisions. The role of a leader is often to facilitate building consensus, and decisions are understood as the sum of all contributions.

**Hierarchy:** Hierarchy plays an important role in the consensus-building process. Leaders are expected to have one-on-one discussions with each member of the decision-making group, and consultation and feedback from higher-ranking members are particularly important.

**Group Identity and Loyalty:** Individuals in Japanese organizations tend to regard themselves as representatives of the group or company. Employees are often loyal to their organizations and companies due to the nature of lifetime employment in corporate or professional organizations.

**Relationship-Oriented:** Building and maintaining relationships is fundamental in Japanese business culture. Long-lasting partnerships are desired, and socializing outside of the office is common.
